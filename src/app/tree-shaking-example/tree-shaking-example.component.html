<h1>Tree shaking example</h1>
<app-used-component></app-used-component>
<p>There is a component above from SomeLib module that is imported to App module</p>
<p>There is also an unused component in that module</p>
<p>
  And if we build an app with or without that unused component or we change some contents of it
  we will see that even a build hash will not change.
  Hence unused components in imported modules will not get to the final bundle of application
</p>
